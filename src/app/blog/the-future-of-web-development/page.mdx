      <H1>The Future of Web Development</H1>

      <P>
        Web development continues to evolve at a rapid pace, with new technologies, 
        frameworks, and methodologies emerging regularly. As we look to the future, 
        several key trends and technologies are poised to shape the next generation of web applications.
      </P>

      <H2>Current Trends Shaping the Future</H2>

      <H3>1. Progressive Web Apps (PWAs)</H3>
      <P>
        Progressive Web Apps combine the best of web and mobile apps, offering offline functionality, 
        push notifications, and app-like experiences without requiring users to visit an app store. 
        As mobile usage continues to dominate, PWAs represent a significant evolution in how we build web applications.
      </P>

      <H3>2. Jamstack Architecture</H3>
      <P>
        The Jamstack approach (JavaScript, APIs, and Markup) separates the front-end from the backend services, 
        pre-rendering pages for better performance. This architecture offers improved security, scalability, 
        and developer experience, making it increasingly popular for modern web projects.
      </P>

      <H3>3. Headless CMSs</H3>
      <P>
        Headless content management systems separate content creation from presentation, allowing developers 
        to use any front-end technology while content editors work in a familiar environment. 
        This decoupling provides greater flexibility and enables omnichannel content delivery.
      </P>
