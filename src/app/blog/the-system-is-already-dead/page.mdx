      <H1>The System Is Already Dead</H1>

      <P>The current education system is on life support—and we all know it.</P>

      <P>The signs are everywhere:</P>

      <UL>
        <LI>Skyrocketing student debt with diminishing returns</LI>
        <LI>Curriculums teaching skills already automated by AI</LI>
        <LI>Employers increasingly valuing portfolios over degrees</LI>
        <LI>A growing mental health crisis among students</LI>
      </UL>

      <P>We're witnessing the slow-motion collapse of a system designed for the industrial age trying to operate in a digital, AI-powered world.</P>

      <H2>The problems are structural</H2>

      <P>Our education system was built to create compliant factory workers. Sit in rows. Follow instructions. Memorize information. Complete standardized tests.</P>

      <P>But today's world demands creativity, critical thinking, and the ability to collaborate with both humans and AI tools—precisely the skills traditional education often suppresses.</P>

      <H2>What's coming next</H2>

      <P>I believe we'll see a massive shift toward personalized, project-based learning. Students will build portfolios demonstrating their abilities rather than collecting degrees. Learning will become lifelong, not limited to young adulthood.</P>

      <P>Most importantly, education will focus on teaching humans to do what only humans can do—think critically, create meaningfully, and connect deeply with others.</P>

      <P>The system may be dying, but what replaces it will be extraordinary.</P>
