      <H1>You're Not Broken — The System Is Optimized for Collapse</H1>

      <P>What a strange moment to be alive.</P>

      <P>Every day, I talk to smart, capable, earnest people who feel:</P>

      <UL>
        <LI>Lost in their careers</LI>
        <LI>Anxious about the future</LI>
        <LI>Paralyzed by information overload</LI>
        <LI>Inadequate compared to peers</LI>
        <LI>Unable to focus on what matters</LI>
      </UL>

      <P>And here's the thing: <strong>they're not broken</strong>.</P>

      <P>They're responding normally to a system optimized for collapse - an education and career landscape that:</P>

      <UL>
        <LI>Trains them for jobs that won't exist</LI>
        <LI>Prioritizes credentials over capabilities</LI>
        <LI>Rewards conformity over curiosity</LI>
        <LI>Values information over transformation</LI>
        <LI>Separates learning from living</LI>
      </UL>

      <H2>The system isn't just broken - it's actively harmful</H2>

      <P>Our education system was designed for an industrial era that's long gone. Today it's:</P>

      <UL>
        <LI>Killing creativity</LI>
        <LI>Disconnecting us from ourselves</LI>
        <LI>Creating dependency instead of autonomy</LI>
        <LI>Teaching compliance instead of critical thinking</LI>
        <LI>Normalizing anxiety and burnout</LI>
      </UL>

      <P>But here's the good news:</P>

      <H2>We don't need to fix the system. We need to create a new one.</H2>

      <P>That's what Mode Collapse is about.</P>

      <P>It's a digital laboratory for:</P>

      <UL>
        <LI>Dismantling outdated approaches to learning</LI>
        <LI>Designing tools that enhance rather than replace human intelligence</LI>
        <LI>Building new pathways to meaningful work and contribution</LI>
        <LI>Connecting people who want to learn differently</LI>
      </UL>

      <P>In machine learning, "mode collapse" happens when an AI gets stuck generating the same limited outputs over and over, missing the full spectrum of possibilities.</P>

      <P>Our education system has experienced its own mode collapse—recycling the same approaches despite diminishing returns.</P>

      <P>I'm creating this space to explore what becomes possible when we break out of that loop.</P>

      <H2>Here's what you'll find here:</H2>

      <UL>
        <LI>Tools for thinking better and learning faster</LI>
        <LI>Frameworks for navigating information overload</LI>
        <LI>Experiments in collaborative sense-making</LI>
        <LI>Conversations with people exploring the frontiers of learning and work</LI>
      </UL>

      <P>If you're feeling stuck, overwhelmed, or unsure where to focus your energy—welcome. You're not broken. And you're not alone.</P>

      <P>The world is full of people ready to learn differently and build something better.</P>

      <P>Let's connect.</P>
