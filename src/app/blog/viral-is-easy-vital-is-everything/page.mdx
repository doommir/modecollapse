      <H1>Viral Is Easy. Vital Is Everything.</H1>

      <P>I've been thinking a lot about what matters on social media lately.</P>

      <P>There's an overwhelming amount of content creation advice focused on going viral. We're told to follow strict formulas: hook viewers in the first 3 seconds, create artificial stakes, use specific keywords and hashtags.</P>

      <P>And look—some of it works! I've seen creators implement these tactics and watch their numbers shoot up.</P>

      <P>But I've been wondering: what's the cost?</P>

      <P>When we optimize solely for views and engagement, are we creating content that improves lives? Or are we just contributing to the noise?</P>

      <P>Here's what I've decided:</P>

      <H2>Viral is easy. Vital is everything.</H2>

      <P>When we create content that's vital—that genuinely helps people solve problems, gain new perspectives, or feel less alone—we're doing something that matters.</P>

      <P>Vital content might not always hit the algorithm jackpot, but it creates real impact. And that impact compounds over time.</P>

      <P>I want to challenge you to ask yourself: "Am I creating content that could genuinely change someone's life for the better?"</P>

      <P>If the answer is yes, you're on the right track—regardless of what the numbers say.</P>
