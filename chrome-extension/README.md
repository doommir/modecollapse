# Lesson Lifter Chrome Extension

This extension generates lesson planning assets from any webpage using OpenAI.

## Development

1. Load the `chrome-extension` directory as an unpacked extension in Chrome.
2. Set your OpenAI API key in the extension options (stored via `chrome.storage`).
3. Right-click on a page or selected text and choose **Generate lesson assets**.

The output will stream into a side panel overlaying the current page.
