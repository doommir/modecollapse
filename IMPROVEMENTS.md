# Mode Collapse - Functionality Improvements

## Button Responsiveness Fixes

### 1. Fixed Nested Interactive Elements
- **Issue**: Buttons wrapped in Links without `asChild` prop caused click issues
- **Fix**: Added `asChild` prop to Button components wrapped in Links
- **Location**: `components/layout/HeroSection.tsx` (Browse Tools button)

### 2. Removed Test Components
- **Issue**: Test buttons with z-index 100 were overlapping content
- **Fix**: Removed `TestSimpleButtons` component from homepage
- **Location**: `app/page.tsx`

### 3. Added Missing Click Handlers
- **Issue**: Workshop waitlist button had no action
- **Fix**: Connected to newsletter modal functionality
- **Location**: `app/page.tsx` (Join the Workshop Waitlist button)

## Enhanced Functionality

### 1. Copy-to-Clipboard for Prompt Tips
- **Added**: Copy button to code snippets in tool detail pages
- **Feature**: Visual feedback with check icon when copied
- **Location**: `components/tools/ToolDetailSimple.tsx`

### 2. Newsletter Signup with Local Storage
- **Added**: Email validation and local storage persistence
- **Feature**: Success/error states with user feedback
- **Locations**: 
  - `components/newsletter-modal.tsx`
  - `app/tools/page.tsx` (sidebar email signup)

### 3. Enhanced Tool Filtering & Sorting
- **Existing**: Already had full filtering and sorting functionality
- **Working**: Search, tag filters, and sort options (relevance, recent, editor's picks)
- **Location**: `app/tools/page.tsx`

## Technical Improvements

### 1. Proper Event Handling
- All buttons now have appropriate onClick handlers
- Forms use proper onSubmit handlers with preventDefault
- No more nested interactive elements

### 2. State Management
- Newsletter subscriptions stored in localStorage
- Proper state updates with visual feedback
- Timeout-based UI transitions for better UX

### 3. Type Safety
- All components maintain TypeScript compliance
- Proper prop types and interfaces

## Preserved Functionality
- All original features remain intact
- No visual design changes
- Navigation, search, and filtering work as intended
- Tool submission form continues to work with n8n webhook
- Mobile responsiveness maintained
