      <P>
        This blueprint outlines an AI-powered web app that transforms any tweet, article, or prompt into a set of five contrasting viewpoints. The goal is to surface hidden assumptions and spark deeper discussion.

      <H2>Pipeline Overview</H2>
      <P>
        A retriever pulls the source material and summarizes it. Five persona agents—skeptic, optimist, historian, futurist, and neutral—then provide their takes. These are critiqued and packaged into final lenses before being saved to the database.
      </P>

      <H2>APIs and Deployment</H2>
      <P>
        Clients create prisms via REST or WebSocket endpoints. The project ships using Fly.io and GitHub Actions for CI/CD.
